**Learning Experience Description:** 
There are many techniques and technologies to help teach and instill knowledge about US Geography. However, many of these digital technologies rely on “point-and-click” learning: in one example, students are given a state name, and asked to identify that state on a map that already shows state outlines. This can lead to an overreliance on stored knowledge, where students rote memorize where the state locations are on a complete nationwide map, without conceptualizing new knowledge about the actual state shapes and how they meld to form the borders within the USA.

The learning problem that I focused on for my final project is that students are over-reliant on rote memorization and fail to identify individual state outlines without seeing a map of the entire US to trigger their stored knowledge from these existing technologies.

The user experience is as follows:
* The user looks at the state shape silhouette 
* The user selects one of three possible options (radio buttons) for which state the shape represents
* If the user isn't sure of their answer, they can click on the state shape, and a new tab will open with a blank US map with state outlines showing. This can help to trigger the stored knowledge based on the state's location within the country
* If the user is still puzzled, they can click the "Check Answer" button, which will pop up an alert telling them whether they chose wisely or poorly
* Once the user has answered all the questions, they will enter their name (as a text field), choose the difficulty of the test (as a checkbox option), and answer whether they would refer this quiz to friends (as a dropdown option)
* Lastly, they will select "Submit Answers"
* All of their answers will appear at the bottom of the screen
* A score will appear, as a percentage, based on the number of correct answers the user selected.
* When the user is done, they can select "Reset Answers" and the following things will happen:
    * All of the radio buttons will uncheck 
    * The name field will return to blank and the placeholder will show
    * The checkbox for the difficulty question will uncheck
    * The dropdown for the referral question will return to the disabled "Choose One" option
    * The printed answers will blank out at the bottom of the screen
    * The printed score will reset to 0, and the percentage sign will disappear (so as not to cause confusion that the user has just scored 0%)
